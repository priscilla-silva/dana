                <h2>Learning Strategies</h2>
                <p>The following strategies have been essential in the process of building this CV:
                    <ul class="aside-ul-top">
                        <li>I first created a basic layout on HTML. When it comes to HTML, the most important
                            thing to keep in mind is to build a layout that is cohesive, organized and clear.
                            I always try to keep in mind <a href="https://blog.tbhcreative.com/10-best-practices-in-html/"> best HTML practices</a>. 
                            I made sure to use coherent classes names and use proper indentation to facilitate 
                            reading and reviewing. My most used resource when laying my first HTML draft is the 
                            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">HTML Element Reference page</a> 
                            on <a href="www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a>, which provides a quick basic overview 
                            of most needed tags. At this time, I also filled in my webpage with various relevant information
                            regarding my education, personal and professional experience. 
                        </li>
                        <li>The second step was filling in my CSS stylesheet with some basic code. I tried using
                            the practice of refactoring (largely based on what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgjnNAU_z-Y">"Made by Christina Truong"</a> 
                            taught) whenever possible, however I am still learning about it and have to therefore
                            perfect my methodology. I also used comments to ease the process of
                            going through the code. As I utilize Visual Studio Code, most inputs given by the software
                            on my CSS stylesheet are pretty self-explanatory, which make the process of finding
                            the correct properties and values faster. This is usually the case for most basic 
                            declaration blocks. I particularly enjoy the process of trial and error as I noticed
                            how well it aids my learning process through problem-solving.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once I created the most basic code on both HTML and CSS, I decided to give the layout
                            structure. Namely, I focused on creating containers, adding margins and padding 
                            as well as lining up different sections using flexbox. I am actually still getting used to
                            flexbox, so I had to consult the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">
                            Flexbox guide</a> on <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> to line up
                            my content properly. This part of the process took the longest, as I went back and forth
                            numerous times to make sure my webpage looked good. 
                        </li>
                        <li>I think appearance is essential in front-end web developement. I followed my personal
                            preferences when picking the font, background image and color-scheme. I also wanted
                            the text to be readable and accessible, therefore I chose black on white, given its 
                            clarity. Regarding accessibility, I also made sure to create a code that would follow
                            a semantic HTML structure from the very beginning. Small details are very important to me, 
                            such as borders, shadows and link hovers. 
                        </li>
                        <li>The biggest challenge I found was using flexbox. I am going to focus on practicing both
                            grid and flexbox to make sure I understand them fully. The biggest takeaway from 
                            completing this assignment was to take one step at a time, be organized and test out
                            little by little to find what looks good and what doesn't. I also have learnt about myself
                            that I enjoy learning by practicing, and it seems to be the most effective tool for me.
                            I always try to solve issues on my own for a while before consulting the internet,
                            as most times a typo or a illogical mistake can ruin the code. It also helps with paying
                            more attention while coding.
                        </li>
                        <li>A few video resources that helped me throughout the process: 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u044iM9xsWU">"Learn flexbox the easy way"</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIO5326FgPE">"Learn CSS Box Model In 8 Minutes"</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JNRQ5HjNeI">"CSS Box-Shadow tutorial: the basics"</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>A few (more) written resources that helped me throughout the process:
                            <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-shadow/">"text-shadow" (CSS-Tricks)</a>,
                            <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/h/hover/">":hover" (CSS-Tricks)</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>For specific questions, issues and doubts, I always try to consult <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">
                            Stack OverFlow</a> to both find a solution and to see if anyone else incurred in the same issue while
                            coding.
